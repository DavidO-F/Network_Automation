Burst-limit is the maximum bandwidth value (either upload / download) to be received by a user
when a burst occurs. The burst-limit value must be greater than the max-limit (MIR) given.
b. Burst-time is the time period used to calculate the average data-rate, not to indicate how long the
burst takes.
c. Burst-threshold is the value that determines when burst can be executed and when burst should be
stopped. The burst-threshold value is generally ¾ of the max-limit value. If the average data-rate
value is lower than the burst-threshold, then the burst will run. But if the average data-rate value is
equal to or greater than the burst-threshold, then the burst will be stopped.
